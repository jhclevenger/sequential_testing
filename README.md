# sequential_testing


Simulations of sequential testing using Bayes factors as the dependent variable. This simulation spans three different effects sizes (d = .2, .5, and .8) and two different testing methods (sequential vs single sample). In the sequential condition, two groups with 10 samples per group are drawn from normal distributions with effect size differences of either .2, .5, or .8. A single sample per group is added until either the Bayes factor exceeds 10, is less than 1/10, or the sample size hits 50 per group. Once the criterion is hit, data is collected for the single sample condition: two new groups are sampled from the same distributions with sample size equivalent to that when the criterion was hit. This allows for equated sample size in both the sequential and single sample conditions. This procedure is repeated 10,000 times for each of the three effect sizes. This results in two groups per sample size (sequential and single sample) that each have 10,000 simulated studies and are equated for sample size.
